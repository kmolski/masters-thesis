The objective of this study is to build and analyse the performance of a Big Data cluster consisting
of Nvidia Jetson Nano minicomputers. This will include the development and benchmarking of programs
using the computer's CPU and GPU. The prepared applications will use Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark
distributed computing platforms. The performance of the cluster will be compared with competing single-board minicomputers.
